Now, I need to proceed with sharing this post to a communication app.\n\nTo do this, I should look for an option or button that allows me to share or copy the link to my recent post. On the current screen, each tweet has several icons below it: comment, retweet, like, view all replies, bookmark, and a share icon (depicted as three connected dots). To share my post, I would typically click the share icon under my own tweet, which will likely open a menu with options such as copying the link, sharing via other apps, or sending directly through messaging apps.\n\nTherefore, my next logical action is to click the share icon beneath my most recent post (the one expressing \"angry\") to initiate the process of sharing it to a communication app.\n</think>\n<answer>\n{\n\"action_description\": \"Click the share icon below your most recent post to begin sharing it to a communication app.\",\n\"action_type\": \"Click\",\n\"action_target\": \"Share icon (three connected dots) located below the tweet expressing 'angry' at the bottom of the visible feed.\",\n\"value\": \"None\"\n}\n</answer>", "pred_action": "click", "pred_input_text": "None", "pred_action_description": "Click the share icon below your most recent post to begin sharing it to a communication app.", "pred_action_target": "Share icon (three connected dots) located below the tweet expressing 'angry' at the bottom of the visible feed.", "pred_coord": [1011, 929]}
