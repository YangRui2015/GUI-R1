The instruction is to find a nearby coffee shop on a map and then call a ride-sharing service. To start this process, I need to open an app that can show me locations on a map. On the screen, there are several navigation and map-related apps available, including \"Maps & Navi...\" (with a map pin icon), \"Waze,\" and \"Uber.\" Since my first step is to find a nearby coffee shop, it makes sense to use an app that specializes in maps and navigation. \"Maps & Navi...\" is likely a dedicated maps/navigation app, which will allow me to search for coffee shops nearby. Therefore, my next action should be to tap on the \"Maps & Navi...\" app to begin searching for a coffee shop.\n</think>\n<answer>\n{\n\"action_description\": \"Tap on the 'Maps & Navi...' app to open it and start searching for a nearby coffee shop.\",\n\"action_type\": \"Click\",\n\"action_target\": \"'Maps & Navi...' app icon with a map pin image, located in the third row, first column from the left.\",\n\"value\": \"None\"\n}\n</answer>", "pred_action": "click", "pred_input_text": "None", "pred_action_description": "Tap on the 'Maps & Navi...' app to open it and start searching for a nearby coffee shop.", "pred_action_target": "'Maps & Navi...' app icon with a map pin image, located in the third row, first column from the left.", "pred_coord": [161, 1285]}
