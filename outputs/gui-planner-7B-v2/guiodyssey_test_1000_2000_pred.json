My most recent post is \"I'm tired now,\" which matches the instruction to post about how I feel today. The instruction also asks me to share this feeling to a communication app. \n\nTo do this, I need to find the sharing options for my post. Next to my \"I'm tired now\" tweet, there is an icon that looks like a share symbol (three connected dots with lines). This is typically used to open up sharing options in social media apps. \n\nGiven the instruction and my goal, the logical next step is to click on this share icon next to my \"I'm tired now\" post so I can proceed to share it via a communication app.\n</think>\n<answer>\n{\n\"action_description\": \"Click the share icon next to the 'I'm tired now' post to bring up sharing options.\",\n\"action_type\": \"Click\",\n\"action_target\": \"Share icon (three connected dots with lines) next to the 'I'm tired now' post at the top of the posts list.\",\n\"value\": \"None\"\n}\n</answer>", "pred_action": "click", "pred_input_text": "None", "pred_action_description": "Click the share icon next to the 'I'm tired now' post to bring up sharing options.", "pred_action_target": "Share icon (three connected dots with lines) next to the 'I'm tired now' post at the top of the posts list.", "pred_coord": [995, 1223]}
