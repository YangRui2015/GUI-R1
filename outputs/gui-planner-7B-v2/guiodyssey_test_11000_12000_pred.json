The first result is an ad for piano lessons in Singapore, which is not relevant since my goal is to find a general piano class video to follow along with. Below the ad, there is a video titled \"Piano Lessons for Beginners: Part 1 - Getting Started! Learn some simple chords\" by MangoldProject, which appears to be a beginner-friendly piano lesson. Since the instruction is to look up a piano class, the logical next step is to select this video so I can view its content and determine what is needed for the class (such as keyboard or other materials). This will help me proceed to the next steps of buying what is needed and setting a study reminder.\n</think>\n<answer>\n{\n\"action_description\": \"Click on the video titled 'Piano Lessons for Beginners: Part 1 - Getting Started!
