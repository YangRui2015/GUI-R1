The instruction is to use social media to post the feeling today and share it to a communication app. Since the Tumblr post is already made, the next step is to share this post via a communication app. Among the available options, there are several contact shortcuts (e.g., Victor James, katsunakusu, chenbt20, tzhau, James Victor) and some app icons (Quick Share, Facebook News Feed, Tumblr, X Post, Threads). To fulfill the instruction, I should select one of these options to share the Tumblr post through a communication channel.
