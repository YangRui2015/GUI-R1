Each day's forecast shows temperature highs/lows and weather icons. The instruction requires me to \"select a day without rain,\" which means I need to identify a day on the forecast that does not have rain or thunderstorm icons.\n\nLooking at the icons, most days show rain or thunderstorm symbols except for Tuesday, June 30th (\"30 Tue\"), which has a sun icon and a high of 67°F and low of 52°F. This suggests clear or partly cloudy weather, making it the only day without rain among those shown.\n\nTo proceed according to the instruction, I should select (click on) the \"30 Tue\" (June 30th) forecast card, as it represents a day without rain.\n</think>\n<answer>\n{\n\"action_description\": \"Click on the forecast card for June 30th (Tuesday), which shows a sun icon indicating clear weather.\",\n\"action_type\": \"click\",\n\"action_target\": \"Forecast card labeled '30 Tue' with sun icon, showing 67°/52°, located in the row of daily forecasts near the top center of the screen.\",\n\"value\": \"None\"\n}\n</answer>", "pred_coord": [0, 0], "pred_action": null, "pred_input_text": "no input text"}
