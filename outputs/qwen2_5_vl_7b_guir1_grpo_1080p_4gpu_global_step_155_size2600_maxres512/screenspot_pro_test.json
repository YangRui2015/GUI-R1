The current screen shows the 'Appearance' settings window, which includes options for switching between light, dark, and auto modes. The 'Auto' option is currently selected, so we need to click on either 'Light' or 'Dark' to switch the mode. Given that the task is to execute an auto switch, clicking on the 'Auto' option will likely cycle through the modes automatically. However, since the task specifies 'auto switch,' it might be interpreted as toggling between light and dark manually, which would require clicking on 'Light' or 'Dark' depending on the current mode. The 'Auto' option is the default setting, but it's not clear if the user wants to manually switch or let the system decide. For simplicity, I'll assume the user wants to toggle between light and dark manually. The 'Dark' option is visible and can be clicked to switch to dark mode.</think>\n<answer>[{'action': 'click', 'point': [1568, 394], 'input_text': 'no input text'}]</answer>", "pred_coord": [2084, 523]}
